Smart Batching for Semantic Search

This module implements a planning system that uses the comention endpoint to determine
chunk volumes per company, then creates optimized baskets of companies for semantic
search queries across multiple time periods with adaptive granularity.

The system uses a two-phase approach:
1. Phase 1: Query the full time period once to get total chunk volumes for all companies
2. Phase 2: Automatically determine optimal time granularity for each company based on
   volume and create baskets that minimize the total number of semantic search queries.
